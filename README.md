# Ideology_Approval_of_USSC

What does legitimacy mean? As it relates to the Supreme Court, political scientists often explore legitimacy in terms of public support for the Court. 
That is, the more support the public has for the Court (either as an institution or for specific cases, depending on the researcher), the more “legitimacy” the Court has. 
When it comes to individual’s assessment of the Court, what is the effect of an individual’s ideological preference and their assessment of the Court’s ideology? I want to know if the individual’s ideology matters for their support of the Court, and how they see the Court’s ideology, if that matters. If they see the Court as conservative, does that matter for their support. 
And then finally, Does the interaction of these variables matter? Does it matter for approval of the Court, if an individual’s ideology matches what they think the Court’s ideology is.
