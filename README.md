# Ideology_Approval_of_USSC

What does legitimacy mean? As it relates to the US Supreme Court, political scientists often explore legitimacy in terms of public support for the Court. 
That is, the more support the public has for the Court (either as an institution or for specific cases, depending on the researcher), the more “legitimacy” the Court has. 
When it comes to individual’s assessment of the Court, what is the effect of an individual’s ideological preference and their assessment of the Court’s ideology? I want to know if the individual’s ideology matters for their support of the Court, and how they see the Court’s ideology, if that matters. If they see the Court as conservative, does that matter for their support. 
And then finally, Does the interaction of these variables matter? Does it matter for approval of the Court, if an individual’s ideology matches what they think the Court’s ideology is.

In answering this question, past studies have generally analyzed smaller samples of about 600 or 1,000. Such studies have conducted experiments with their own survey data, which typically feature more direct measurements of Court legitimacy and attitudes for the court. The goal of this paper is to do an exploratory analysis to see what kind of findings I might get with a much larger sample. The dataset for this paper comes from the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES). In accounting for legitimacy of the Court, the best question that comes close asked respondents to rate how strongly they approve or disapprove of the job the Supreme Court is doing. This, of course, is the main variable of interest and as such is the dependent variable in the model.

Figure 1 shows results from the first model without the interaction variable for respondent ideology and Court ideology. Because the dependent variable is a four-level factor variable denoting job approval for the Supreme Court, the model ran is an ordered logistic regression model. The results from the first model indicate that approval for the other federal institutions (Congress and the Presidency) positively and significantly impact the likelihood of respondents expressing job approval for the Supreme Court. What is more, these variables are suggested to have the most impact in the model, which aligns with Gibson and Nelson’s (2015) argument regarding support for other institutions and legitimacy. 

Finally, take notice that while the variables representing respondent ideology and their perception of the Court’s ideology do not have the largest coefficients, both are significant in the model. The effect for placement of the Court’s ideology is negative, suggesting the more conservative an individual places the Court’s ideology, the less likely they are to give the Court a favorable job approval rating. This result aligns with Haglin et al.’s (2020) findings that support for the Court is more strongly related to perceptions that the Supreme Court is more liberal than conservative.
